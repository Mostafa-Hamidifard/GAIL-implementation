# GAIL-implementation

Have you heard of Generative Adversarial Imitation learning (GAIL)? I'm going to implement it on some simple tasks.

There are some essential parts:

1) generating expert data
2) training on expert data
3) testing and reporting the results

Considering these steps, a proper project hierarchy is needed.
Todo: checking what has been saved from expert data.
adding seed and save it
showing the data visually.
after that, creating GAIL architecture
